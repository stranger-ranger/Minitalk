This project introduces you to signals in the UNIX operating system. In this case, you have to write two programs: a client and a server.  These programs must "communicate" using signals to transmit a message from the client to the server. I solved this problem as follows: I consider each letter of the message as an argument of a character type, which contains 1 byte. As you know, 1 byte is 8 bits that can contain 0 or 1. If in the first bit 1 - I will send SIGUSR2 to the server, otherwise SIGUSR2. In turn, the server will process these signals and "collect" a letter of ones and zeros. In the bonus part, we have to send more than 8 bits so that all unicode characters "fit" into our alphabet.
